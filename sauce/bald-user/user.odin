package core_user

/*

These are concepts the core bald layer relies on.

But they vary from game-to-game, so this package is for interfacing with the core.

---

TODO, I wanna yeet this because it's a bit yuckie. Some notes:

We could likely untangle this and make the data required in the renderer just be stuff like blank types.
But it'd subtract from the ease of calling the high level draw functions, so probs not the best idea...

it would go from:

draw.draw_sprite(..., .shadow_medium, z_layer=.shadow, flags=.flag2)

^ types are known and can be inferred

to:

draw.draw_sprite(..., int(Sprite_Name.shadow_medium), z_layer=int(ZLayer.shadow), flags=u8(Quad_Flags.flag2))

^ unknown, so we'd need to do more typing

...

orrrr, maybe the solution is to just move the draw_sprite into the bald_helpers ??
that way we have the fast path by default with known types

then the lower level stuff would be unknown types and the renderer can not care...

that would probably be a good fix. will try that in future.

I'll keep this like this for now, since I'm not sure if there's gonna be other types we need in future that have a more tricky workaround needed.
